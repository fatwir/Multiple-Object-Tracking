# Multiple-Object-Tracking
In many real-life situations, multiple objects need to be detected and tracked, like cameras that
have a track of the people passing through the check-in counter in an airport terminal and the
type of luggage they carry in, vehicles passing through a traffic signal etc. In this report, an
algorithm to track multiple objects using Kalman filter is discussed where the scene is monitored
by a fixed camera, from which data is extracted. The result obtained shows that moving multiple
objects are efficiently tracked under real-time conditions. <br>
